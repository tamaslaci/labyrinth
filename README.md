## Labyrinth project
> Study project for my 'Programming technologies' class at the University
> for practicing JAVA language concepts.

The code runs a game application with the use of Swing GUI and JDBC with an SQL database.

The player's goal is to get through a randomly generated, horizontal or vertical,
maze and reach the trophy while only a small scope of the maze can be seen around the player and the time is measured.
The player have to avoid the deadly dragon of the maze, because it can kill the player in a neighboring field.
The dragon moves randomly from a randomly choosen field in the center area.
The player can move in four directions with the WASD or arrow buttons and starts from the lower left corner,
and have to get to the upper right corner for the trophy.
